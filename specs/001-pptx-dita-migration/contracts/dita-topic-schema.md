# DITA Output Schema

The generator's contract is to produce DITA topics and ditamaps that
slot into the existing pub-9/pub-10 publishing toolchain unchanged.
This document fixes the exact shape of the generated XML so a future
maintainer (and the test suite) can verify each topic without referring
back to the source spec.

All output files are:

- UTF-8 encoded, no BOM
- LF line endings (`"\n"`) — the publishing toolchain on Linux build
  machines is happier with LF than CRLF
- An XML declaration (`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`) followed by
  the OASIS DOCTYPE for the root type — `topic.dtd` for topics, `map.dtd`
  for ditamaps. Oxygen identifies a file as DITA by its DOCTYPE public ID;
  without it the DITA Maps Manager rejects a bare `<map>` ("This file does
  not appear to be a DITA map") and Author will not recognise a bare
  `<topic>`. (Earlier revisions omitted both, on the assumption that Oxygen
  only needed them at validation time — that proved wrong for authoring,
  so the preamble is now emitted into the source tree. `publish_html.py`
  still tolerates DOCTYPE-less inputs by injecting them only when absent.)

## 1. `gram_NN.dita` — single gram topic

One DITA topic per gram. The body groups everything for that gram into
a single page: the instructor-only Analysis Sheet section first, then
one block per `.glc` link beneath the gram header in the source PPTX,
in `sequence` order.

A gram with N `.glc` links and one analysis sheet therefore produces
**one** `gram_NN.dita` file containing one analysis section plus N
per-GLC blocks — not N+1 DITA topics. The CSV still carries N+1
rows per gram (one per `topic_type=glc` row and one for
`topic_type=analysis`); the generator groups them by
`(publication, chapter, gram_id)` and folds them into one topic.

Each `topic_type=glc` row produces one of two block shapes, chosen
by the extension of the asset named by the GLC's inner
`data_source/filename` (carried through the CSV in `png_path`):

| GLC inner filename ends in | Block shape | Asset copied into gram folder |
|---|---|---|
| `.png` / `.jpg` / `.gif` | §1.2 GramFrame table embedding the image | The image file |
| `.wav` | §1.3 GLC-viewer link | Both the `.glc` and the referenced `.wav` |
| anything else | row skipped (§2) | none |

The split is automatic and driven by file extension; the legacy
`wav_treatment` CSV column is retained for round-trip compatibility
only and is ignored by the generator (see csv-schema.md §column 15).

### 1.1 Analysis-sheet section

Built from the `topic_type="analysis"` row's `png_path` column
(populated by the extractor after FR-023 normalisation). The section
carries `audience="-trainee"` so the trainee profile elides it
entirely; only the instructor build includes the analysis sheet.

| Asset suffix | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `.png` | Embedded inline via `<image href="{slug}.png" .../>` |
| `.docx` (or any other suffix) | Linked via `<xref href="{slug}.docx" format="docx" scope="local">Analysis Sheet</xref>` |

The `slug` is the slug of the *source* filename (e.g. `Analysis Sheet.docx`
→ `analysis-sheet.docx`); see §10.

### 1.2 GramFrame table block

One `<table outputclass="gram-config">` per `topic_type="glc"` row
whose inner-GLC asset is a still image (i.e. `png_path` ends in
`.png` or `.jpg`). The shape is exactly what `gramframe.bundle.js`
expects after DITA-OT renders it; see
[`gramframe.md`](./gramframe.md) for the rendered-HTML contract and the
reason the two `<colspec>` elements are not optional.

Placeholders:

| Placeholder | Source |
|---|---|
| `NN` | `gram_id` numeric portion (zero-padded as it appears) |
| `vessel_name` | CSV column; if empty, the entire `<ph>` element is omitted |
| `image_href` | Slugified copy of the asset, placed in the same per-gram folder as the topic (see §10) |
| `time_end` | CSV column; if empty, literal `""` is written |
| `freq_end` | CSV column; if empty, literal `""` is written |
| `display_text` | CSV column; the PPTX link label (e.g. `"Lofar 1"`). When non-empty, emitted as the section `<title>` so multi-gram pages get a clear heading per spectrogram. Omitted entirely when blank. |

### 1.3 GLC-viewer link block

One `<xref>` block per `topic_type="glc"` row whose inner-GLC asset is
audio (i.e. `png_path` ends in `.wav`). The block is a single
paragraph linking to the `.glc` file:

```xml
<section>
  <title>{display_text}</title>
  <p><xref href="{slug}.glc" format="glc" scope="local">{display_text}</xref></p>
</section>
```

The student PC has a GLC-viewer application installed which opens the
`.glc` file, reads its inner `data_source/filename`, and loads the
named `.wav` from disk for aural analysis. The viewer expects the
WAV to sit next to the GLC (the `<filename>` element carries only a
bare filename, not a path), so the generator copies **both** files
into the per-gram folder under their slugified names (§10) — the
`.glc` becomes the topic-relative `xref` target, and the `.wav`
travels with it so the viewer can resolve it.

No `<image>` is emitted for these rows: there is no pre-rendered
spectrogram to embed, and the gram-config table's time/freq metadata
already lives inside the GLC for the viewer to consume directly.

`display_text` is the human-readable label exactly as it appeared in
the PPTX run (e.g. `"Lofar 1"`), distinct from `link_href` which is
the raw URI from the PPTX hyperlink.

### 1.4 Redirected lofar — `<data>` provenance (feature 006)

When a `topic_type="glc"` row carries a resolvable `master_png_path`
(see `csv-schema.md` → optional columns), its lofar is **redirected**:
the asset is **not** copied into this gram's folder. The §1.2/§1.3
block is emitted unchanged except that (1) the `<image>`/`<xref>` href
is a topic-relative `../` path to the single master copy in the master
gram's folder, and (2) a provenance element is appended as the **last**
child of the lofar `<section>`:

```xml
<data name="original-asset-path" value="{link target's original local path}"/>
```

- `@value` is the original local path of the **link target** — the row's
  `png_path` for an image lofar, its `glc_path` for an audio lofar (never
  the `.wav`). For audio the redirected `<xref>` targets the master `.glc`,
  and the large `.wav` stays adjacent to that master `.glc`.
- `<data>` is part of the standard DITA metadata domain (DTD-valid, no
  specialisation), survives DITA-OT, and is suppressed from default trainee
  XHTML. Its **presence alone** flags the lofar as redirected — no separate
  `@outputclass` token.
- The element plus the master href are a complete inverse transform:
  `rehydrate_dita.py` copies the master link target (and, for a pair, its
  adjacent `.wav`) back under the local slug recomputed from `basename(@value)`,
  re-localises the href, and removes the `<data>` element — yielding a topic
  indistinguishable from a never-deduplicated one. See
  `specs/006-large-asset-deduplication/contracts/dita-provenance-data.md`.
- Absent on non-redirected lofars (the inert-by-default case).

## 2. Skipped rows

A `topic_type="glc"` row contributes no block to its gram topic when
its asset cannot be classified — i.e. `png_path` is empty, the
referenced file is missing, or its extension is none of `.png`,
`.jpg`, or `.wav`. Each skip is recorded one-per-line in
`skipped.txt`:

```
publication=main chapter=arctic-survey gram_id="Gram 05" topic_type=glc sequence=1 reason="png_path missing"
```

The gram topic still renders provided at least one other row for the
same gram survived dispatch.

## 6. Ditamaps

### 6.1 Main ditamap (`main.ditamap`)

```xml
<map title="Main">
  <topichead navtitle="{Chapter Title}">
    <topicref href="main/{chapter-slug}/gram-NN/gram_NN.dita"/>
    <!-- ...one topicref per gram, in CSV order... -->
  </topichead>
  <!-- ...further chapters in alphabetical folder order... -->
</map>
```

Notes:

- The ditamap lives at the output root next to its sibling `main/`
  folder, so `topicref` URLs are simple forward paths into that
  folder (no `../` prefix).
- One `topicref` per gram — the CSV's N+1 rows per gram collapse into
  one `gram_NN.dita` and therefore one ditamap entry.
- `topichead` `navtitle` is the human-readable chapter title (mixed
  case), distinct from the chapter slug used in URLs.

### 6.2 Test ditamap (`progress-test-N.ditamap`)

```xml
<map title="Progress Test N">
  <topicref href="progress-test-N/gram-NN/gram_NN.dita"/>
  <!-- ...one topicref per gram, flat... -->
</map>
```

No `topichead` elements (FR-012, section 1.11 of the source spec).

## 7. Manifest (`manifest.txt`)

Plain text. One line per file produced. Sorted alphabetically.
Paths relative to `--out`. Includes ditamaps.

```
main.ditamap
main/arctic-survey/gram-01/analysis-sheet.docx
main/arctic-survey/gram-01/gram_01.dita
main/arctic-survey/gram-01/lofar-1.png
progress-test-1.ditamap
progress-test-1/gram-01/gram_01.dita
...
```

## 8. Filename conventions

| Artefact | Filename |
|---|---|
| Gram topic | `gram_NN.dita` (e.g. `gram_12.dita`) |
| Main ditamap | `main.ditamap` |
| Test ditamap | `progress-test-N.ditamap` (e.g. `progress-test-1.ditamap`) |

`NN` is the numeric portion of `gram_id` exactly as it appears in the
CSV (no padding adjustments). The expectation is that the source
material uses two-digit numbering today; if it grows past 99 the format
silently widens to three digits. There is exactly one DITA topic per
gram regardless of how many GLC/WAV links it carries — the legacy
per-link `gram_NN_lofarM.dita` filenames are obsolete.

## 9. Folder layout

Each gram (a single `gram_id` within a publication) lives in its own
sub-directory. The grouping mirrors the supporting-material folder
structure in the source content (one folder per gram, in the chapter
or per-publication root) so that locating an asset on disk needs no
look-up table.

```
{out}/
├── main.ditamap
├── main/
│   ├── {chapter-slug-1}/
│   │   ├── gram-NN/
│   │   │   ├── gram_NN.dita
│   │   │   ├── analysis-sheet.docx   ← analysis asset (or analysis.png)
│   │   │   ├── lofar-1.png           ← one image per GLC link (see §10)
│   │   │   ├── lofar-2.png
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── gram-NN/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── {chapter-slug-2}/
│       └── ...
├── progress-test-1.ditamap
├── progress-test-1/
│   ├── gram-NN/
│   │   ├── gram_NN.dita
│   │   ├── analysis-sheet.docx
│   │   └── lofar-1.png
│   └── gram-NN/
│       └── ...
├── progress-test-2.ditamap
├── progress-test-2/
│   └── ...
├── manifest.txt
└── skipped.txt   (only when at least one row was skipped)
```

Each ditamap is paired with a similarly-named sibling content folder
at the output root. Inside a content folder, each gram (a single
`gram_id`) lives in its own `gram-NN/` sub-directory, where `NN` is
the numeric portion of `gram_id` exactly as it appears in the CSV
(zero-padded to at least two digits by the extractor; widens silently
past 99).

## 10. Asset copy and rename

The DITA-writing phase is responsible for materialising a
self-contained publication tree. For every topic that references an
external asset (image screenshot, GLC + WAV pair, or analysis sheet),
the generator:

1. Resolves the source path as `--image-root` joined with the relevant
   CSV column. For image and analysis blocks the asset path comes
   from `png_path` (the extractor resolves it against the image
   root so the generator can copy it blindly). For §1.3 GLC-viewer
   blocks the `.glc` itself is resolved from `glc_path` and the
   companion `.wav` from `png_path` — the pair is copied side-by-side
   so the on-PC GLC viewer can read its `<filename>` element and
   find the audio next to it.
2. Copies the source file(s) into the topic's per-gram folder (`gram-NN/`).
3. Renames the copy to a slug of the *source* filename, preserving the
   original extension lower-cased. For example, the Lofar-1 image of
   `gram_12.dita` whose source is `Lofar 1 ABC.PNG` is copied to
   `gram-12/lofar-1-abc.png`. A WAV-typed GLC row whose
   sources are `Lofar 1 I.glc` and `Lofar 1 I.wav` copies both files
   to `gram-NN/lofar-1-i.glc` and `gram-NN/lofar-1-i.wav` so they
   stay paired by basename.
4. Uses the bare local filename as the topic's `href`. References
   never traverse out of the per-gram directory.

The per-gram folder gives each asset a unique location automatically:
two grams in the same chapter that both have a source `Lofar 1.png`
end up at `gram-NN/lofar-1.png` and `gram-MM/lofar-1.png`, with no
collision. Slugifying the filename keeps hrefs URL-safe (no spaces,
ASCII only) without losing the human-readable relationship to the
source.

Asset copies use `shutil.copy2`, which preserves the source's modification
time. Two consecutive generator runs against an unchanged source tree
therefore produce byte- and stat-identical assets, satisfying the
idempotency contract (R9).

If a referenced source file is missing, the generator logs a warning
and emits the topic with the *intended* local href anyway. This keeps
the topic XML stable across runs: dropping the asset into the source
tree at the expected path and re-running the generator resolves the
dangling reference without touching the topic file.

The manifest (`§7`) lists every file the generator writes — topics,
ditamaps, **and** copied assets — relative to `{out}`.

## 11. HTML preview (development only)

The DITA tree at `{out}` is the production deliverable, consumed by
Oxygen XML Author for publishing. For development sanity-checks, the
project ships `publish_html.py`, which renders the same tree to HTML5
using DITA-OT. The HTML output is not delivered to the air-gapped
target — Oxygen remains the production publishing path (FR-021).

`publish_html.py` operates on `{out}` non-destructively:

1. Stages a copy of `{out}` under `.dita-build/`. The source DITA already
   carries the OASIS Topic/Map DOCTYPE declarations per §0, so staging
   injects them only if absent (tolerating older DOCTYPE-less trees);
   DITA-OT requires them to classify elements. Ditamaps already sit
   at the root of `{out}` with forward-only hrefs into their sibling
   content folders, so no path rewriting or promotion step is needed.
2. Invokes DITA-OT once per staged ditamap with
   `--format=html5 --processing-mode=lax`, writing to
   `html/{ditamap-stem}/`.
3. Removes the staging directory once publishing completes.

The script's only inputs are `--dita` (default `dita/`), `--out`
(default `html/`), and `--dita-ot` (path to a DITA-OT installation
that the maintainer transfers across the air-gap per FR-021).
